This box inspector code classifies incoming parts for the NIST competition according to the results of a logical camera snapshot referenced to a shipment (order) of a specified number of parts. The images show the output of the classification for 2 different orders - an ideal order and an order with fewer parts than the camera sees.

This code is still under development.
